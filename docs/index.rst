   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Radon's documentation!
=================================

Radon is a Python tool which compute various code metrics. Supported metrics are:

    * raw metrics: SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, &c.
    * Cyclomatic Complexity (i.e. McCabe's Complexity)
    * Halstead metrics (all of them)
    * the Maintainability Index (a Visual Studio metric)

Radon can be used either from the command line or programmatically through its
API.
